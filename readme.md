# Chatbot Design Systems: Examples
This project contains examples for my series of blogs conserning Chatbot Design Systems.

This series is addressed with questions like
 - Spotting weaknesses in chatbot design
 - Implementing chatbot design
 - Comparing the implementation with the design
 - Updating the design based on user interaction

## First Example: Combining Sample Sentences with the Flow
The first example is a tool that converts yaml into a graph. 
This tool can help you with combining the sample sentences that you've designed with your high level flow.
Additionally, this tool can help you spot weaknesses in your design
and facilitates the translation of the design into implementation.

### Prerequisites
- [python](https://www.python.org/)
- [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/)

### Usage
When you have installed the dependencies using the command `pipenv install` 
you can simply run `pipenv run python render_design_graph.py` in the command line and the graph wil automatically open.
